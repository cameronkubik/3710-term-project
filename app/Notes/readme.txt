Application Name: Aubie Ball

Description:
    This game is a knock off of the classic arcade game Frogger.
    The player starts by selecting a difficulty and then proceeds to attempt to make it across the field without being hit by the defense.
    If the player gets hit, the game is over.
    If the player successfully makes it across the field the time is recorded.

Build Instructions: None

Developers note:
    The implementation to get animated defensemen to continuously flow across the screen was much more difficult than anticipated.
    The libraries required to dynamically change a Views position at runtime used far more RAM than was actually being allocated to my app.
    It is because of this reason the actual gameplay was not implemented.
